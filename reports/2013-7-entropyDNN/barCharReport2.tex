\section{BarChart}
To my surprise, the average entropy calculated by the bin and parzen window both expose an ascending nature(I expected it to be descending from the first hidden layer).\\
\textbf{Problem:}There are a lot of 0-bins, I use a htxSmooth method the assign non-zero values to these bins.(by pulling a line from first left bin and first right bin.)
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.80]{figs/htxSmoothedEntropy.eps}
\caption{entropy after htxSmooth}
\end{figure}
Note that for probability density estimation we assume a continuous distribution, so the entropy is not guaranteed to be greater than zero, I use 1000 sample nodes to calculate the $\int f log2(f) $.

The average abs coefficient value of each layer, however, is ascending(It's the only positive result I get).

\section{Experiment result}
Based on our intuition, we did some experiments. They are on 40-hour Chinese dataset.
